# Creating Your First Graph with Giraffe

Let's create a simple line graph with Giraffe.

Giraffe is designed work with within React apps.
We'll start assuming you already have a React app set up that you would like to use.
If not, try using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) can help you start one.

First we need to define a component that will render our visulization:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

const MyLineGraph: React.FC = () => {
  // TODO
}

export default MyLineGraph
```

Next, we need some data.
Giraffe can accept data from a variety of sources, but for now we'll start by just defining some simple fixture data as a variable:

```tsx
const LINE_DATA = [
  {month: 0, temperature: 12},
]
```



- need a component
- need some input data
  - here's that
- need to transform input data to table format (link) using fromRows
- define a config
- pass the config to a plot component
